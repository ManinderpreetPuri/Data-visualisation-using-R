# Data-visualisation-using-R

TASK  1
Using	the	data	contained	in	the	file	covid_au_state.csv,	I created	a	visualisation that:	
• Shows	 the	 total	 number	 of	 new	 confirmed	 cases	 daily	 throughout	 Australia	 since	 the	 first	 cases	
recorded	on	25	January	2020.	Highlighted	the	three	days	with	the	highest	number	of	new	cases.	
• Compares	the	daily	growth	factor	across	all	the	eight	states	in	Australia	from	17	March	2020	to	16	
August	2020.	(The	growth	factor	is	calculated	by	dividing the	new	cases	on	the	current	day	with	the	
new	cases	of	the	previous	day.)

[Data	source:	covid19data.com.au.]

TASK	2 
Using	the	data	contained	in	the file grand_slam_data.csv,	I created	a	visualisation	that:
• Compares	 the	 performance all	 the	 winners	 for each	 of	 the	 four Grand	 Slam tournaments (Australian	 Open,	 French	 Open,	 Wimbledon,	 U.S. Open);	 and	 highlights	 the	 top	 winner	 for	 each	
tournament.
• Shows	and	highlights	how	many	times	the	winners and	the	runner-ups met	each	other	on	each	of the	Grand	Slam	tournament	finals for	the	40	most	recent	tournaments (from	2008	to	2017).

TASK	3 
Using the	 data	 contained	 in	 the	 file	big_stock_data.csv,	 created	a	 Shiny	 interactive	 data	 visualisation	that allows	the	user	to:
• View	the	change	over	time	of	a	chosen	share	based	on	either	the	closing	price	or	the	share	volume.
• Compare the	shares	performance	between	two	or	more	companies.

TASK	4 
Using	the	data	contained	in	the	file	crime_data.csv and	the	ggmap R	package,	created	a Shiny interactive	data	visualisation	that	allows	the	user	to:
• View	the	spatial	density	of	one	or	more	offense types in	the	Houston	area.	
• View	the	 spatial	 density	 of	 all	 the	 crimes	 happened	 for	 a	time	 period (e.g.	 from	 01/03/2010	 to	
30/04/2010).
